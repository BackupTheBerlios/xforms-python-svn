*** Limitations ***

- Some parameters in functions are not correctly handled yet
(e.g. void *), as ctypes is somehow rigid and a free cast
on-the-fly equivalent to C's is not so viable. So some functions
here use a 3-types approach when possible: None, long, or FL_OBJECT.
- To compare two FL-objects you can use fl_is_same_object(..),
instead of using 'if obj == someobj'
- For some functions who use some parameters as an address
value (e.g. in c: &a) that is modified by the function
itself, there has been a change in API so these arguments
represent multiple return values here.
- First two parameters of fl_initialize (len(sys.argv) and
sys.argv) are ignored, to prevent an unexplicable segfault:
so command line arguments are not usable.
- public functions are not guaranteed to remain stable and
consistent, until version 1.0.0 will be released. So library
name and directory layout might change in order to achieve
a better reorganization.
- some ported-to-python XForms c function are for internal
use or low level work in XForms: as maybe they are not useful
in python, will be commented/disabled, when I find all of them.
- this software is mainly focused on GNU/Linux operating
systems. Apple MacOS and MS Windows are not supported, yet.
Other unix-like operating systems may or may not be working.
- not all public functions are working, for now. I am quite
sure public functions used by examples in related directory
are working well. Other ones are being tested on case-by-case
basis (as type conversion from python to c are somehow
problematic, in some critical cases).
- testing is much appreciated, but be warned this software
is in a alpha development state, presently.



*** Ideas for further development ***

- reduce chance to incur in Segmentation Fault/Illegal Instruction
(need a deeper testing) (the highest priority).

- for each acquired c function I need to improve a python
wrapping function, in order to check if a parameter of
correct type has been passed and convert it. (high priority) {WIP}.

- convert XForms c examples to be used as python scripts
(they can be used as working tests as well) (high priority) {WIP}.

- polish wrapper to remove unnecessary comments {DONE}

- verify external functions/data from Xlib and C stdlib
to be resolved and correct related shared library loaded
by ctypes, remove external functions not directy referenced
by XForms library.

- verify all c macro conversion's correctness (if needed) {DONE}.

- do a simple and meaningful docstring for every public
function; this is absolutely annoying as I have to manually
copy functions' description and parameters' lists from XForms
documentation, so it may take several months. But, meantime,
I plan to rename functions' parameters, where possible, in
order to improve usability. {WIP}

- have a minimal but complete function reference guide; I
do not intend to do a real developer/user manual as
xforms.pdf present in XForms is absolutely great and
functions call in xforms-python are only slightly modified {WIP}.

- find some way to get rid of all direct X11/Xlib functions,
depending only on XForms library functions (hopefully).

- Porting code from Python 2.x to 3.x (while keeping 2.x
compatibility). Main problem, I guess, is Unicode strings
that are not supported yet in XForms (this should not be a problem
for most of strings used in functions, but it *is* surely a problem
in 1 byte-characters used for keys, shortcut etc...)

- Adopting RestructuredText format (rst) in functions' docstrings,
replacing epytext format {DONE}.

- Module deprecated.py will be removed (as I don't see a reason to
support it, as it contains functions and variables already deprecated
by XForms developers). Before removing it is necessary to get rid
of examples that are based on that module's functions and port them
to alternative functions.

- Covering all (public) functions with a proper unit-test (or a sort
of). My intention is to have at least 3 use cases for each : 1st for
a surely working solution (i.e. parameters of correct type and values
range), 2nd for a failing/not working but error-checked and managed
solution (xforms-python catches incorrect types and/or values), 3rd
for a failing/not working and not checked/not managed solution (it
should display original XForms error messages and so relies on XForms
upstream library error handling).

- Creating a python tool to parse/convert .fd (XForms's fdesign files)
to python.

- Figuring out which values in xfdata.py can be used as single values
 or bitwise OR-ed with each other, so check_admitted_value_in_list
 function doesn't forbid such a resulting value incorrectly.

- Porting xforms-python to object-oriented/classes (maybe for version 2.x,
lowest priority).
