Ideas for further development:

- reduce chance to incur in SegmentationFault (need a more
deep testing) (the highest priority)

- for each acquired c function I need to create a python
wrapping function, in order to check if a parameter of
correct type has been passed. (high priority)

- convert XForms c examples to be used as python scripts
(they can be used as working tests as well) (high priority)

- polish wrapper to remove unnecessary comments

- verify external functions/data from Xlib and c stdlib
to be resolved and correct related shared library loaded
by ctypes, remove external functions not directy referenced
by XForms library

- verify all c macro conversion's correctness

- do a simple and meaningful docstring for every public
function

- have a minimal but complete function reference guide
(I do not intend to do a real developer/user manual
as xforms.pdf present in XForms is absolutely great)
