To use xforms-python you have to import its modules. You can do that
importing package directly (new preferred way):

    import xformslib

e.g. import xformslib
(you will need to use xformslib.fl_<xxx> for functions and
xformslib.FL_<XXX> for data)
e.g. import xformslib as xfl
(you can use xfl..fl_<xxx> for functions and xfl.FL_<XXX> for data)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following methods are NOT recommended anymore:

-) importing code/data from needed module(s) implicitly (not really
recommended as it pollutes namespace):

    from xformslib.<MODULENAME> import *

e.g. from xformslib.flbasic import *

You can then call xforms-python functions and use constants directly
without any prefix, e.g. fl_initialize(...)


-) importing needed module(s) explicitly (if you don't want pollute
namespace and you need to use only few modules), one of more in a bunch:

    from xformslib import <MODULENAME>

e.g. from xformslib import flbasic

You then need to call xforms-python functions and use constants, prefixing
them with the module name, e.g. flbasic.fl_initialize(...).


You can mix more modules importing them at once as e.g.:
from xformslib import flbasic, flxbasic, xfdata

You can also use an abbreviation as e.g.:
from xformslib import flxbasic as flxb
