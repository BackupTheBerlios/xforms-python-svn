To use xforms-python you have to import its modules. You can do that
in two preferred ways:


1) importing code/data from needed module(s) implicitly (not really
recommended as it pollutes namespace):

    from xformslib.<MODULENAME> import *

e.g. from xformslib.flbasic import *

You can then call xforms-python functions and use constants directly
without any prefix, e.g. fl_initialize(...)


2) importing needed module(s) explicitly (if you don't want pollute
namespace and you need to use only few modules), one of more in a bunch:

    from xformslib import <MODULENAME>

e.g. from xformslib import flbasic

You then need to call xforms-python functions and use constants, prefixing
them with the module name, e.g. flbasic.fl_initialize(...).



You can mix more modules importing them at once as e.g.:
from xformslib import flbasic, flxbasic, xfdata

You can also use an abbreviation as e.g.:
from xformslib import flxbasic as flxb
