xforms-python requires at least Python 2.6.x. It does not support
Python 3.x yet.

It requires:
- python standard library modules (including ctypes), and
- XForms (X11) toolkit library.


To install this package (including python modules, documentation and
examples), simply run the following with root's privileges:
   python ./setup.py build install

Documentation files (API docs included) are installed in
"/usr/doc/xforms-python-$VERSION/", by default.
If your operating system/distribution uses another directory for doc
files, you may use, e.g.:
   python ./setup.py build install --install-data=/usr/share
(to install in "/usr/share/doc/xforms-python-$VERSION/")


This software is mainly intended to be used on GNU/Linux. For other
operating systems your mileage may vary.

Read TODO file for usage limitations.
