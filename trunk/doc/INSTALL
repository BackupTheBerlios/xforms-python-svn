xforms-python requires (at least) Python 2.6.x. It does not support
Python 3.x yet.

It requires:
- python standard library modules (including ctypes), and
- XForms (X11) toolkit library.


To install this package (including python modules, documentation and
examples), simply run the following with root's privileges:
   python ./setup.py build install

Documentation files (API docs included) are installed in
"/usr/share/doc/xforms-python-$VERSION/" and example files in
"/usr/share/xforms-python-$VERSION/", by default.


This software is mainly intended to be used on GNU/Linux. For other
operating systems your mileage may vary.

Read TODO file for usage limitations.
