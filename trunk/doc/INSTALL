xforms-python requires at least Python 2.6.x (or python 2.5.x
with the most recent ctypes). It doesn't support Python 3.x yet.

It requires:
- python standard library modules (including ctypes), and
- XForms (X11) library.


To install this package (including python modules and documentation),
simply run the following with root's privileges:
   python ./setup.py build install

Documentation files (except API docs) are installed in
"/usr/doc/xforms-python-$VERSION/", by default.
If your operating system/distribution uses another directory for doc
files, you may use, e.g.:
   python ./setup.py build install --install-data=/usr/share
(to install in "/usr/share/doc/xforms-python-$VERSION/")


To install example files you can use:
   python ./install_examples.py
(to install in "/usr/share/xforms-python-$VERSION/")
If your operating system/distribution use another directory for them, 
you may use:
   python ./install_examples.py --datadir=<otherdir>
(to install in "<otherdir>")


To install API docs (LaTex format) you have to copy doc/tex/ directory.


This software is mainly intended to be used on GNU/Linux. For other
operating systems your mileage may vary.
