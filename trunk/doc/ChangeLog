SVN (first entries from top are more recent)
--------------------------------------------

BETA
    20110102 (beta9)
    * Python 3.x should be almost supported now (remaining questions to
    resolve are utf-8 encoding and unicode strings and single characters,
    but XForms upstreams needs to be ported to Unicode before).
    * minor bugfixes for pixmapbutton in fd2python. Added some minimal
    example files created as .fd and converted to .py using fd2python.py
    * removed test_fl_add_io_callback.py and created a test_flbasic.py
    test instead.
    20110101 (beta8)
    * xfdata.py Structures now have a __slots__ attribute, to reduce
    memory usage.
    * Some other miscellaneous bugfixes and typos. Some more docstrings
    in xfdata (for Structures) and in other modules (for function
    prototypes).
    20101231 (beta7)
    * bitmapbutton's pixmapbutton's usedata cases now implemented in
    fd2python. Removing fl_set_dial_return() as deprecated.
    20101230 (beta6)
    * fd2python is almost complete.
    * bugfix for fl_set_button_mouse_buttons(). Removed value check for
    fl_set_object_return(), as multiple bitwise OR are allowed.
    20101229 (beta5)
    * about a half of fdesign objects are now manageable by fd2python.py.
    * corrected shortcut in nmenu_minimal.py example.
    * bugfix in ndial.py example (as reported and suggested by Jens Thoms
    Toerring).
    20101227 (beta4)
    * bugfix in fl_initialize()
    * fd2python.py added, to convert .fd fdesign files to xforms-python .py
    (not completed yet).
    20101224 (beta3)
    * some leftover typos and bugs fixed. Moving most of constants' possible
    values description from xfdata.py into concerning functions.
    20101223 (beta2)
    * some other bugs fixed. Managed special sequences to be passed to
    fl_popup_add_entries(), fl_popup_insert_entries(), fl_add_select_items(),
    fl_insert_select_items(), fl_replace_select_item(), fl_add_nmenu_items(),
    fl_insert_nmenu_items(), fl_replace_nmenu_item() functions, so separate
      additional args are now supported using python keyword params.
    20101221 (beta1)
    * some miscellaneous bugfixes.
    * Modified some functions with a parameter of str type who can have None
    value, so they now require empty str (""), instead of None. Bugfix in
    fl_vclass_name(). Managed FL_IOPT * param for fl_set_defaults().
    Now fl_initialize() supports command line arguments, as FL_CMD_OPT *
    is managed. Modified examples to replace empty appoptions param from 0
    to None. Added arrowbutton_var example to show FL_CMD_OPT wrapper.
    Managed FL_RESOURCE * param for fl_get_app_resources().
    * xforms-python has now entered in beta development state! Hopefully most
    functions should be reasonably stable now.

ALPHA
    * changed descriptions for color params. Some misc. corrections.
    * continuing params' names change to be more meaningful. Some bugfixes
    and some typos fixed.
    * pointer-to-something params have now meaningful names (WIP),
    c-compatible type have clearer prefixes (WIP). Bugfixes and typos.
    make_flpopupitem now verifies type, state and shortcut keys.
    donothing_popupcb as placeholder callback function moved to xfstruct.py.
    fl_set_color_leak() removed (backwards). Realign to upstream XForms
    1.0.94pre4: new fl_full_library_version() function.
    * bugfixes in some examples. butttype.py example added.
    * managed how to correctly handle char** in fl_set_pixmap_data (thanks to
    Mark Tolonen, on ctypes-users mailing-list). Some adjustments in examples.
    New iconify_var.py example.
    * new handling of ubyte array in library.py. Bugfixes for fl_state and
    fl_vmode.
    * unit-tests introduced for some flbitmap.py's functions. Some
    better type checks in library.py.
    * Realign to upstream XForms 1.0.94pre3. Add demo33_var.py example.
    * adjustments for pydoc-generated html files. Remove old and unused
    internal directory.
    * setup.py takes care of examples and html files' installation now.
    Some malformed docstrings corrected. Remove local links in html files and
    create a custom index.html to do a modules list.
    * Simplified documentation layout (now you don't need epydoc anymore),
    html files are now generated using pydoc. Massime docstrings reorganization.
    Bugfixes and typos' correction. flstruct.py renamed to xfstruct (as it is not
    part of upstream XForms).
    * New file flstruct.py for functions to prepare xfdata Structures to be
    used in fl* functions. Some corrections in flnmenu and flpopup (WIP).
    * Realignment to upstream XForms version 1.0.94pre1. New mode for importing
    python package and examples' adjustment. Bugfixes. Some examples remain to
    adjust.
    * Realign to upstream XForms version 1.0.93.
    * Functions to add and insert entries in popups and derived entities
    (nmenus and selects) supports special sequencies (even if some problematic
    aspects may still apply).
    * most of Structure classes in xfdata.py have a docstring now.
    * some bugfixes and other docstrings improved.
    * some docstrings improved.
    * restored correctness of all examples.
    * introduce a new convenience function for checking admittable values
    with non-fatal consequences (checknonfatal_allowed_value_in_list), as
    some function can use different values than pre-defined ones).
    check_admitted_value_in_list renamed to checkfatal_allowed_value_in_list.
    * some bugfixes. Realign to upstream XForms. RGB color triples documented.
    * Finally deprecated.py module is gone. Remaining examples who used
    deprecated functions are removed and replaced by: buttonall_new.py, 
    thumbwheel_new.py
    * better error handling (error message more complete). First unit-test
    (fbasic.py fl_add_io_callback's function).
    * polished code to comply (mostly) with PEP8. Clarify use of pointer
    to void 'vdata' parameter as any type, remove vdata type checking.
    * corrected list of admitted values for align and place, as library's
     check_admitted_value_in_list function didn't recognize bitwise OR-ed
     values. Corrected XForms' corresponding version.
    * introduced support of strings in c_void_p parameters in flbasic. New
    support function in library.py to check if a function is correctly passed
    as parameter (e.g. in callback making functions). Fixed a bug in
    library.py's check_admitted_value_in_list.
    * some bugfixes in code (most of warnings fixed using pylint, pychecker and
    pyflakes) and docstrings finally compliant to epydoc reStructuredText.
    * performing a check for all complex structures (e.g. FL_OBJECT, FL_FORM
    ..) in needed fl_* functions, in order to verify if their type complies
    with XForms expectations. Some renaming in library's convenience functions.
    Some bugfixes in functions' initialization and docstrings. Remaining files
    switched to reStructuredText. Some descriptions in functions' docstrings
    are not complete yet.
    * docstrings in flpositioner.py and flscrollbar.py switched to
    reStructuredText.
    * docstrings in flnmenu.py switched to reStructuredText.
    * docstrings in flflinput.py and flmisc.py, switched to reStructuredText.
    * new convenience functions in library.py for checking complex object
    instances.
    * docstrings in flfilesys.py, flflimage.py, flformbrowser.py,
    flglcanvas.py, flgoodies.py switched to reStructuredText. Realign to
    upstream XForms code (flimage_free not returning).
    * docstrings in flcounter.py, flcursor.py and fldial.py switched to
    reStructuredText. Some corrections in docstrings format. Corrected
    cursor.py example.
    * docstrings in flclock.py switched to reStructuredText.
    * docstrings in flchart.py switched to reStructuredText.
    * docstrings in flcanvas.py switched to reStructuredText.
    * docstrings in flbutton.py switched to reStructuredText.
    * docstrings in flbrowser.py switched to reStructuredText.
    * docstrings in __init__.py, flbasic.py and flbitmap.py switched to
    reStructuredText.
    * Realign to upstream XForms code (fl_object_returned function removed).
    * All examples have been adapted. Nonetheless preemptive demo is
    partially broken.
    * another bunch of adapted examples. Some more docstrings.
    * most examples are being re-adapted to new modules' structure and
    get rid of global variables in them (using python class when
    necessary).
    * flclock example renamed to clock.py to avoid confusion with module.
    * choice_new and folder_new (replacing deprecated functions) added.
    * massive code reorganization. Its purpose is to realign my code
    distribution with files' structure already used by XForms upstream.
    So I will create and modify some files, to be used from now on:
    - flbasic.py, flbitmap.py, flbrowser.py, flbutton.py, flcanvas.py,
    flchart.py, flclock.py, flcounter.py, flcursor.py, fldial.py,
    flfilesys.py, flformbrowser.py, flglcanvas.py, flgoodies.py,
    flinput.py, flnmenu.py, flpopup.py, flpositioner.py, flscrollbar.py,
    flselect.py, flslider.py, flspinner.py, fltabfolder.py,
    flthumbwheel.py, fltimer.py, flxbasic.py, flxyplot.py, flflimage.py;
    - flmisc.py, for upstream corresponding files that have only one or two
    viable functions each (box, clipbd, frame, free, AAA, zzz, etc..);
    - vers.py, containg version information only;
    - oldfunc.py renamed to deprecated.py, and maintained for deprecated
    functions and variables;
    - library.py will contain only support/not public functions;
    - xfdata.py will be maintained, reordered.
    Not all demos in examples/ directory are adapted yet.
    * some examples adapted to getter functions's .value modification.
    * pObject and pForm as parameters renamed to pFlObject and pFlForm, to
    avoid confusion with python "object" type.
    * start restructuring of docstrings, to introduce @type again for all
    parameters. Bugfixes and typos corrections.
    * new checks for pointer to FL_OBJECT/FL_FORM existence, and for
    required initialization.
    * other functions are tested and documented.
    * lowlevel fl_strdup() removed.
    * another bunch of functions have been tested and documented; in getter
    functions who return multiple values use .value attribute to return value
    and not ctypes type.
    * use some constants from X11/keysymdef.h to be used with
    fl_set_object_shortcutkey.
    * another bunch of functions tested and documented.
    * Porting of chartstrip example.
    * some more function tested and documented
    * removed backward fl_show_errors function.
    * workaround for fl_set_input_format to accept characters (e.g. "/") and
    ascii numeric values (e.g. 47), as separator.
    * some more docstrings and checked parameters
    * flps_* functions (except flps_init) are removed from library. After an
    interesting discussion with XForms upstream maintainer I've decided to get
    rid of them as they has been undocumented already in old (0.89) docs, and
    they should be used only in fd2ps program (just in case I leave a
    placeholder and they are moved to a temporary file, too).
    * some revision of docstrings
    * realign to upstream (modification of color parameter in flps_*)
    * other docstrings; added simpletable example.
    * Some function parameters with value in a range list are documented
    * Realign to upstream. Some docstrings completed.
    * Demo examples adapted to new internal/deprecated situation.
    * Deprecated from upstream functions are temporarily moved to a separate
    python file: you will have to explicitly import "oldfunc.py" if you want
    to use them. Anyway they are scheduled for removal in about six months
    from now.
    * some more variables' docstrings.
    * internal and deprecated variables (if not used for menu/pup/choice
    functions) are removed from xfdata (just in case I leave a placeholder
    and they are moved to a temporary file, too).
    * XForms internal and low-level functions I am aware of are (hopefully)
    removed from library, as they are not supposed to be used here (just in
    case I leave a placeholder and they are moved to a temporary file).
    * testing status of function with a working example is completed
    * First bunch of testing status of functions inserted in docstrings
    * Deprecated from upstream functions (old menu/pup/choice and two
    xlplot functions) are now clearly labeled and documented as such,
    as they may be removed anytime.
    * some more docstrings.
    * Added nmenu_minimal example.
    * Thanks to Jens T. Toerring, now FL_POPUP_ITEM management
    is correctly supported (for one item with a dict or a single
    list, for more than one with a series of lists) in functions
    who use it.
    * separated namespace for xfdata preserved in library.
    * bugfixes in demo file because of some commented deprecated
    variables.
    * introduce some new functions for nmenus and popups
    (realigning with upstream XForms).
    * library prepared to be able to give status of testing,
    documentation, example presence, and working state.
    * Get rid of API-diversion.txt, insert API change state in
    docstrings (more easily keeping update)
    * Porting of demotest2 example.
    * some variables in xfdata have now their docstrings (and can be
    documented in .tex files)
    * Porting of demotest3 example.
    * Porting of demo27 example.
    * Start a global review to monitor functions for
    completing docstrings and testing real working state
    (this surely will take several weeks, but I think it's
    absolutely necessary).
    * FL_POINT argument better handled in functions who used it
    as parameter.
    * Re-sync with upstream XForms adjustments.
    * Porting of iconify example (partiually, as some segfault
    problems prevent a complete porting).
    * some docstrings and bugfixes
    * Porting of grav example.
    * HTML documentation will be only on website (too heavy to
    be uploaded every time). New documentation format will be LaTex.
    * Porting of nmenu example.
    * more docstrings
    * Porting of select example.
    * bugfixes in some demos. Add lalign_pixmap example.
    * Complete correction of names in demo files (e.g. pobj is
    a meaningful name than obj for a pointer to object, and
    .contents is better than [0] to deal with pointer to Structure
    attributes)
    * Thanks to J. T. Toerring (XForms current maintainer) I
    can finally get rid of my ugly hacks for .visible,
    .active, and object comparison.
    * Get rid of api.pdf, use html documentation for API,
    instead.
    * Correct some names in demo examples to avoid confusion
    * Re-sync with XForms upstream adding some new getter
    functions.
    * Bugfixes.

    * Porting of buttonall example.
    * Porting of touchbutton example.
    * some bugfixes to avoid undefined names
    * There's no point keeping types (xfstruct.py) and constants
    (xfconst.py) separated: merge both into xfdata.py
    * Porting of free1 and fonts examples.
    * Porting of timer example.

    xforms-python) and print a warning if there is a mismatch.
    * Porting of arrowbutton example
    * Verified type conversion from py function to c-compatible.
    * Raw conversion's product needed to be reworked, as
    there were some problems:
    - parts related to c standard library and X development
    library are present (I've yet to understand if they are
    necessary to be included and if they have to be loaded
    explicitly by ctypes);
    - some types are uncorrectly recognized as "unknown *"
    (they have to be replaced with another coherent type);
    - constants definitions are not ordered according to
    the same order of original c header (I'm willing to
    maintain same order, so future adaptation is easier);
    - some blocks of code are not converted and are simply
    missing (lack of functionality to comply with, seriously)
    - there are unuseful comments, so .py file is too much
    crowded (aesthetic reorganization).

0.0.1 (20091027)
    Internal release.
    This is the byproduct of c to py raw conversion,
    using gccxml and h2xml.py/xml2py.py from CtypesLib
    (little gems, to avoid much of raw work).
