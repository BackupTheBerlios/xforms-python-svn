    * Porting of arrowbutton example
    * Verified type conversion from py function to c-compatible.
    * Raw conversion's product needed to be reworked, as
    there were some problems:
    - parts related to c standard library and X development
    library are present (I've yet to understand if they are 
    necessary to be included and if they have to be loaded
    explicitly by ctypes);
    - some types are uncorrectly recognized as "unknown *"
    (they have to be replaced with another coherent type);
    - constants definitions are not ordered according to
    the same order fo original c header (I'm willing to 
    maintain same order, so future adaptation is easier);
    - some blocks of code are not converted and are simply
    missing (lack of functionality to comply with, seriously)
    - there are unuseful comments, so .py file is too much
    crowded (aesthetic reorganization).

0.0.1 (20091027)
    Internal release.
    This is the byproduct of c to py raw conversion,
    using gccxml and h2xml.py/xml2py.py from CtypesLib
    (little gems, to avoid much of raw work).
