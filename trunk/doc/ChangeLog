    * some bugfixes to avoid undefined names
    * There's no point keeping types and constats separated
    merge both into xfdata.py
    * Porting of free1 and fonts examples.
    * Porting of timer example.
    * Switch to python package format instead of a single module
    * Porting of yesno_cb example.
    * keep reference of elements (param names), too.
    * Porting of demo33 example.
    * Porting of pushme example.
    * Porting of colsel example.
    * start improving docstrings to include function purpose
    and parameters' meaning
    * continue replacing names, bugfixes.
    * reduce some lines length to prevent warnings.
    * Start replacing some function parameters who are python
    keywords or other reserved words.
    * Porting of borderwidth example.
    * Some bugfix to avoid "Illegal Instruction" because of
    inappropriate position of reference to prevent garbage
    collector.
    * verify version compatibility (between XForms library and
    xforms-python) and print a warning if there is a mismatch.
    * Porting of arrowbutton example
    * Verified type conversion from py function to c-compatible.
    * Raw conversion's product needed to be reworked, as
    there were some problems:
    - parts related to c standard library and X development
    library are present (I've yet to understand if they are 
    necessary to be included and if they have to be loaded
    explicitly by ctypes);
    - some types are uncorrectly recognized as "unknown *"
    (they have to be replaced with another coherent type);
    - constants definitions are not ordered according to
    the same order of original c header (I'm willing to 
    maintain same order, so future adaptation is easier);
    - some blocks of code are not converted and are simply
    missing (lack of functionality to comply with, seriously)
    - there are unuseful comments, so .py file is too much
    crowded (aesthetic reorganization).

0.0.1 (20091027)
    Internal release.
    This is the byproduct of c to py raw conversion,
    using gccxml and h2xml.py/xml2py.py from CtypesLib
    (little gems, to avoid much of raw work).
