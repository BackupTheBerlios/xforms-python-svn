This file describes documentation currently available for xforms-python.

If you need a guidance to xforms-python API, you should read (in this order):

* demos examples in examples/ directory
* LaTex documentation (.tex) files in doc/tex/ directory, as API reference
* XForms-toolkit documentation (.html or .tex files) available from
XForms homepage (http://www.xforms-toolkit.org): most of XForms docs
applies also to xforms-python, with some adaptations (e.g. python language
specific instead of C's, some functions parameters have a different API,
etc..). This is a really good guide.

You can produce .pdf file from .tex, using a provided script.
