This file describes documentation currently available for xforms-python.

If you need a guidance to xforms-python API, you should read (in this order):

* functions' docstring in python code, or HTML documentation (.html) files
in doc/ directory, as API reference.
* demos examples in examples/ directory
* XForms-toolkit documentation (.html or .tex files) available from
XForms homepage (http://www.xforms-toolkit.org): most of XForms docs
applies also to xforms-python, with some adaptations (e.g. python language
specific instead of C's, some functions have a different API, different
purpose and number of parameters, etc..). This is a really good guide.


Every fl* function has a status representing its current development state:

a) status of testing:
    1) Tested: it is fully tested and working
    2) HalfTested : there is at least one occurence of good functioning
    3) Untested: not tested or not working
b) status of documentation:
    1) Doc: fully documented (function usage, parameters, and usable values)
    2) NoDoc: not fully documented
c) presence of demo/example:
    1) Demo: there is at least one example (ported from upstream or minimal)
    2) NoDemo: no demos/examples are available/ported
d) Usable state:
    1) OK: it is usable (if Tested and Demo-ed, or Tested and Documented)
    2) NOT OK: its usage is not verified or it fails under some conditions
