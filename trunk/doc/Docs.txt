This file describes documentation currently available for xforms-python.

If you need a guidance to xforms-python API, you should read (in this order):

* functions' docstring in python code, or HTML documentation (.html) files
in doc/ directory, as API reference.
* demos examples in examples/ directory
* XForms-toolkit documentation (.html or .tex files) available from
XForms homepage (http://www.xforms-toolkit.org): most of XForms docs
applies also to xforms-python, with some adaptations (e.g. python language
specific instead of C's, some functions have a different API, different
purpose and number of parameters, etc..). This is a really good guide.


Every fl* function has a status entry in docstring representing its current
development state:
a) status of unit-testing coverage:
    1) UnitTest: it is fully covered by 1 working and 2+ failing unit-tests
    2) Half-UTest: there is at least one occurence of failing tests
    3) NA-UTest: not covered by unit-tests, yes
    4) NN-Utest: unit-test is pointless here (no args, no return value)
b) status of documentation:
    1) Doc: fully documented (function usage, parameters and usable values)
    2) NoDoc: not fully documented
c) presence of demo/example:
    1) Demo: there is at least one example (ported from upstream or original)
    2) NoDemo: no demos/examples are available or ported
d) Usable state:
    1) OK: it is almost surely well usable (only if Demo-ed and Documented, or
       Tested and Documented)
    2) Maybe: there are no demos and no unit-tests, only documentation; its
       usage is not verified or it may fail under some circumstances
    3) KO: doc is not complete, unit-test and demos do not exist; it is known
       to be incomplete or not handled well; it is likely supposed to fail on
       run.
