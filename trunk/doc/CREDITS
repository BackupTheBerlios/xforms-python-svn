This work could not be possible without the following really great people
I owe huge thanks and a respectful acknowledgement to:

Past and current maintainers:

Same acknowlegement applies to XForms documentation as I've used plenty
of it for functions' descriptions, classes and variables docstrings.

I would particularly mention Jens Thoms Toerring for his dedication,
helpfulness and patience with problems I've found while implementing
this python port, thus a special commendation goes to him.

I wish to thank also:
- Python author and maintainers (for python standard library)
and
- Xorg X11 Window System developers (for some constants and structures from
X-Window system include files I had to use, and correlative X documentation).
