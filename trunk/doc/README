xforms-python

Python wrapper to XForms X11 Window System GUI C toolkit library.
It has nothing to do with W3C XML XForms.

I have some goals to achieve:
- maintaining application programming interface's compatibility with
XForms library, as much as possible, except for some needed
adaptations.
- keeping a low level of dependencies (python standard library, only)
