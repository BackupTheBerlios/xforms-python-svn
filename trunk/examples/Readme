Here are a few demos (ported from XForms to xforms-python)
demonstrating the usage and appearance of object classes in
the xforms-python. These programs also serve as testing/QA
programs, so if you have a problem with a particular object,
see if the same object works in the demo program.

Examples named as *_new and *_minimal are original, as well as
simpletable.

Note: not all XForms demos will be ported to python, as some
of them use directly not avoidable X11 library functions whom
I am not going to support in xforms-python.

All bitmap/pixmap image files are part of XForms (see CREDITS
file for acknowledgements), and are used only for the purpose
of related functions' usage demonstration.
