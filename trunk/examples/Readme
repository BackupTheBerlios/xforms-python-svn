Here are a few demos demonstrating the usage and appearance
of object classes in the xforms-python. These programs also
serve as testing/QA programs, so if you have a problem with
a particular object, see if the same object works in the
demo program.

All demos have been ported from XForms .c demos to python.

All bitmap/pixmap image file are part of XForms (see CREDITS
file for acknowledgements), and are used only for the purpose
of usage demonstration.
