Here are some demos (ported from XForms to xforms-python)
demonstrating the usage and appearance of flobject classes
in the xforms-python.
Examples named as *_new, *_minimal, *_miscell are original,
instead, as well as simpletable.py.

These programs also serve as testing/QA programs, so if you
have a problem with a particular flobject, see if the same
flobject works in the demo program.

Note: not all XForms demos will be ported to python, as some
of them use directly not avoidable X11/OpenGL libraries'
functions whom I am not going to support in xforms-python.

All bitmap/pixmap image files are part of upstream XForms
(see CREDITS file for acknowledgements), and are used only
for the purpose of related functions' usage demonstration.
